# AI Agent System - Community Edition TODO

## Core Features Completed ‚úÖ
- Multi-provider AI routing (Venice.ai, Anthropic, Perplexity)
- Intelligent content classification for optimal model selection
- Vector-based memory with Qdrant integration
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Conversation continuity and session tracking
- Automatic failover and resilience mechanisms

## Priority 2: Method Implementation Issues (By Folder)
### agent/api.py
- [‚úì] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in register_model method (lines 70-77) (FIXED: already correctly implemented with object initialization first)
- [‚úì] Fix incorrect UsageCost constructor call (lines 699-707) (FIXED: already correctly implemented with object initialization first)

### agent/core.py
- [‚úì] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in init_default_models (lines 39-47) (FIXED: added missing required properties like provider, capabilities, context_window, and display_name)
- [‚úì] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in _update_model_performance method (FIXED: added missing required properties like provider, capabilities, context_window, and display_name)
- [‚úì] Implement streaming response handler for non-Venice providers (FIXED: implemented streaming response handler for Anthropic client)

### agent/cost_control.py
- [‚úì] Fix constructor calls for CostControlStrategy, UsageCost, and ModelEfficiency (FIXED: updated all constructors to initialize objects first then set attributes)
- [‚úì] Fix reference errors to prioritize_cost, prioritize_speed, and prioritize_accuracy attributes (lines 335-337) (FIXED: added null checks before accessing attributes)

### agent/memory.py
- [‚úì] Fix QdrantClient dependency issues (possibly unbound error) - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: added proper null checks, mock classes, and import handling)
- [‚úì] Resolve type errors in search response handling for Qdrant results (line 215) - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: improved type handling with Dict[str, Any] for payloads)
- [‚úì] Fix Payload type incompatibility with Dict[str, Any] return type - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: added proper type conversion and error handling)

### agent/perplexity.py
- [‚úì] Standardize stream response handling with other clients (FIXED: streaming implementation already matches the standardized approach)

### agent/models.py
- [‚úì] Ensure streaming implementation is working correctly with error handling (warning seen in logs) - MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED: added improved error handling, timeout detection, and graceful error recovery)

## Priority 3: Enhancements to Complete
- [‚úì] Fix format_timestamp filter missing in history.html template (FIXED: added Jinja2 filter implementation)
- [‚úì] Complete the integration of dynamic model discovery between Perplexity and Anthropic - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented _register_provider_models method and automatic model registration for both Perplexity and Anthropic)
- [‚úì] Implement proper fallback mechanisms when primary model fails - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented sophisticated fallback selection based on model performance metrics with multiple fallback paths for resilience)
- [‚úì] Standardize streaming response format across all providers - MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented consistent streaming format with timeout handling, error recovery, and completion signaling for all providers)
- [‚úì] Fix constructor issues in data models (CostControlStrategy, UsageCost, ModelEfficiency, ModelPerformance) - LOW PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented proper constructors with meaningful default values and documentation for all data model classes)
- [‚úì] Add utility to randomly select models for testing/evaluation - LOW PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented sophisticated random model selection utility with multiple strategies including uniform, weighted, least-evaluated, provider-balanced, and smart balanced selection)
