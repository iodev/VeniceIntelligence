# Agent System TODO List

## Critical Fixes
- Fix `'Agent' object has no attribute 'model_performance'` error in the agent core module
- Modify agent to properly track model performance metrics

## Enhancements to Complete
- Complete the integration of dynamic model discovery between Perplexity and Anthropic
- Add `clear_memories` method to `MemoryManager` class
- Add utility to randomly select models for testing/evaluation
- Fix constructor issues in data models (CostControlStrategy, UsageCost, ModelEfficiency, ModelPerformance)
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms when primary model fails

## Suggested Enhancements
- Add parallel query execution for high-accuracy mode
- Implement confidence scoring system to determine when multiple providers should be used
- Create a model registry system that tracks all available models across providers
- Add performance metrics dashboard for comparing model efficiency
- Implement automatic deprecation of underperforming models
