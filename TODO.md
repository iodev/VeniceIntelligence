# Agent System TODO List

## Priority 1: Critical Fixes
- [✓] Fix naming inconsistency in memory management: app.py calls `clear_memory()` but MemoryManager implements `clear_memories()` (FIXED: the method was already using clear_memories correctly)
- [✓] Fix undeclared/undefined `cost_monitor` reference in app.py's update_strategy route (line 522) (FIXED: replaced with agent.cost_monitor references)
- [✓] Fix `'Agent' object has no attribute 'model_performance'` error in the agent core module (FIXED: updated _get_best_model to use database directly instead of the local model_performance dictionary)
- [✓] Implement missing can_use_high_accuracy_mode method in CostMonitor class (FIXED: implemented the method with budget and complexity-based logic to determine when to use high accuracy mode)
- [✓] Implement conversation continuity between queries (FIXED: added session tracking and conversation history maintenance)

## Priority 2: Method Implementation Issues (By Folder)
### agent/api.py
- [✓] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in register_model method (lines 70-77) (FIXED: already correctly implemented with object initialization first)
- [✓] Fix incorrect UsageCost constructor call (lines 699-707) (FIXED: already correctly implemented with object initialization first)

### agent/core.py
- [✓] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in init_default_models (lines 39-47) (FIXED: added missing required properties like provider, capabilities, context_window, and display_name)
- [✓] Fix LSP error for ModelPerformance constructor in _update_model_performance method (FIXED: added missing required properties like provider, capabilities, context_window, and display_name)
- [✓] Implement streaming response handler for non-Venice providers (FIXED: implemented streaming response handler for Anthropic client)

### agent/cost_control.py
- [✓] Fix constructor calls for CostControlStrategy, UsageCost, and ModelEfficiency (FIXED: updated all constructors to initialize objects first then set attributes)
- [✓] Fix reference errors to prioritize_cost, prioritize_speed, and prioritize_accuracy attributes (lines 335-337) (FIXED: added null checks before accessing attributes)

### agent/memory.py
- [✓] Fix QdrantClient dependency issues (possibly unbound error) - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: added proper null checks, mock classes, and import handling)
- [✓] Resolve type errors in search response handling for Qdrant results (line 215) - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: improved type handling with Dict[str, Any] for payloads)
- [✓] Fix Payload type incompatibility with Dict[str, Any] return type - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: added proper type conversion and error handling)

### agent/perplexity.py
- [✓] Standardize stream response handling with other clients (FIXED: streaming implementation already matches the standardized approach)

### agent/models.py
- [✓] Ensure streaming implementation is working correctly with error handling (warning seen in logs) - MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED: added improved error handling, timeout detection, and graceful error recovery)

## Priority 3: Enhancements to Complete
- [✓] Fix format_timestamp filter missing in history.html template (FIXED: added Jinja2 filter implementation)
- [✓] Complete the integration of dynamic model discovery between Perplexity and Anthropic - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented _register_provider_models method and automatic model registration for both Perplexity and Anthropic)
- [✓] Implement proper fallback mechanisms when primary model fails - HIGH PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented sophisticated fallback selection based on model performance metrics with multiple fallback paths for resilience)
- [✓] Standardize streaming response format across all providers - MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented consistent streaming format with timeout handling, error recovery, and completion signaling for all providers)
- [✓] Fix constructor issues in data models (CostControlStrategy, UsageCost, ModelEfficiency, ModelPerformance) - LOW PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented proper constructors with meaningful default values and documentation for all data model classes)
- [✓] Add utility to randomly select models for testing/evaluation - LOW PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented sophisticated random model selection utility with multiple strategies including uniform, weighted, least-evaluated, provider-balanced, and smart balanced selection)

## Priority 4: Suggested Enhancements
- [✓] Add parallel query execution for high-accuracy mode - MEDIUM PRIORITY (FIXED: implemented concurrent.futures ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel execution of queries across multiple providers with timeout handling, latency tracking, and enhanced error recovery)
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring system to determine when multiple providers should be used - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] Create a model registry system that tracks all available models across providers - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Add performance metrics dashboard for comparing model efficiency - LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Implement automatic deprecation of underperforming models - LOW PRIORITY
