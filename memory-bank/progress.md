# Project Progress

## Current Status
- Memory bank system initialized with core files
- Architecture patterns documented
- Requirements and constraints defined
- Technical context partially established
- Documentation framework created

## Implementation Progress
**Completed:**
- Project brief and scope definition
- Product context and problem statement
- System patterns and key decisions
- Memory bank structure and rules

**In Progress:**
- Technical context documentation
- Active context updates
- Component integration tracking
- Security framework implementation
- UI monitoring capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Complete technical context documentation
2. Establish agent communication layer
3. Implement supervisor orchestration
4. Set up Docker infrastructure
5. Begin security implementation

## Known Issues
- Memory bank auto-updates not yet implemented
- Cross-file context linking needs validation
- Component relationship mapping requires expansion
- Transport protocol implementation is pending
- Documentation completeness needs verification
