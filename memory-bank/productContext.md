# Product Context

## Project Purpose
To create a unified system that coordinates multiple AI agents through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, enabling complex task execution through intelligent workflow orchestration.

## Problem Statement
1. Difficulty managing multiple AI agents for complex workflows
2. Need for standardized communication between agents
3. Lack of visual monitoring for multi-agent coordination
4. Security challenges across distributed components
5. Complexity in deploying and maintaining agentic systems

## Solution Overview
The system will:
- Implement adaptive workflow orchestration through supervisor agents
- Support multiple communication transports (HTTP, SSE, TCP)
- Provide visual interfaces for workflow monitoring and management
- Include security controls for agent communication and data flow
- Offer comprehensive documentation and knowledge management

## User Experience Goals
1. Developers can define agent workflows with minimal configuration
2. Visual interface updates in real-time with <500ms latency
3. Configuration process works seamlessly for Python and JS environments
4. Security features are transparent yet enforceable through policies
5. Documentation includes working examples and API references

## Success Metrics
1. Coordinate 10+ MCP agents simultaneously
2. Visual interface updates with <1s delay
3. Support all required communication transports
4. Security coverage for all system components
5. Complete documentation for all system aspects
