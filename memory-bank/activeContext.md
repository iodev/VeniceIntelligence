# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
1. Implementing multi-agent coordination through supervisor_agent.py and orchestrator.py
2. Optimizing Docker-based deployment for all components
3. Integrating MCP servers with dual transport support (HTTP/SSE + TCP)
4. Developing security features with OAuth proxy integration
5. Creating visual interface for real-time workflow monitoring

## Recent Changes
1. Completed systemPatterns.md with core architectural patterns
2. Updated productContext.md with detailed success metrics
3. Implemented initial TCP transport reliability features
4. Enhanced security layer with compliance check framework
5. Created documentation structure for all components

## Next Steps
1. Finalize agent registration and discovery implementation
2. Complete real-time status updates through SSE
3. Verify security integration with OAuth proxy
4. Optimize memory footprint to stay under 5GB
5. Complete documentation updates across all components

## Important Patterns
1. Observer pattern for status updates (critical for real-time monitoring)
2. Composite pattern for workflow structure (essential for complex task execution)
3. Strategy pattern for transport selection (enabling flexible communication)
4. Facade pattern for API abstraction (simplifying system control)
5. Factory pattern for agent creation (standardizing agent initialization)

## Project Insights
1. Visual interface requires tighter integration with orchestration layer
2. Security layer needs enhanced documentation for transparency
3. MCP server transport must support seamless fallback mechanisms
4. Docker deployment should include environment-specific configurations
5. Documentation updates must align with all core components
